          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>“A thoroughly capable all-round coupe. But not a purebred Toyota ”
            It’s a very complete coupe. Big enough inside, well equipped, handsome, rapid and good-natured. It’s grown-up, yet compact, agile, yet smooth. It’s a clever piece of engineering. A car you’d enjoy driving anywhere, a car that probably strikes the best compromise of GT and sportiness of any car in its class. 
            
            But that also means it doesn't really shine brightest, either. We seem to have an absurd amount of choice in the £40-60k sports car market at the moment. There's Caymans and Alpines if you want handling, a BMW M2 if you want a surprisingly lithe hot rod, and the likes of BMW's M440i coupe if you want something really grown up. With numerous soft-tops peppered in amongst them all. But if you love the way the Supra looks - and can't resist its iconic badge, in its Nineties font - then the rest of the car is good enough to justify giving this a try.</p>
